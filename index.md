## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="photo1.jpg"> 

Hi there, welcome to my website!

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jianhua Tang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kvlKtAEAAAAJ&hl=en).  

My research goal is to empower AI with capabilities beyond the human level to _assist humans effectively_ in diverse areas such as decision-making and complex problem-solving. I am particularly interested in two interconnected questions:  
- (i) How can AI research draw inspiration from human learning processes?
- (ii) How can these insights be advanced to provide greater benefits in real-world scenarios?

To achieve my goal, my current research interests lie in **natural language processing** and **machine learning**, and I am particularly interested in AI (self-)evolution/improvement. I am currently working as a research intern under the guidance of Prof. [Jiaxin Huang](https://teapot123.github.io/) at Washington University in St. Louis.
